13	Following a pilot study in Italy and Spain, analysis of carriers (n = 11,609) collected through 24 study groups participating in the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA) detected significant modification of breast cancer risk by HMMR rs299290 variant among BRCA1, but not BRCA2, mutation carriers: BRCA1 mutation carriers n = 7,584, Cox proportional-hazards regression model, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.08 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.13), ptrend = 0.004 (p 2df = 0.014), in the same direction as originally detected in Ashkenazi Jewish populations; BRCA2 mutation carriers n = 3,965, HR = 1.03 (95% CI 0.96-1.10), ptrend = 0.42 (p 2df = 0.67)	breast cancer	rs299290

15	However, while the rs299290 variant represents a missense change predicted to be benign (V368A; concordant predictions for PolyPhen-2 and SIFT were obtained), it is in linkage disequilibrium (according to HapMap Caucasians data: D' = 1 and r2 = 0.48) with rs299284 (R92C in Entrez accession number NP_036616), which is predicted to be damaging	SIFT	rs299290

19	In data provided by several CIMBA groups (Text S1), no ER-positive tumors were observed among rare rs299290 homozygotes in BRCA1 mutation carriers (p interaction = 0.006), whereas this bias was not observed in BRCA2 mutation carriers (p interaction = 0.95) (Table S4)	tumors	rs299290	
20	That is, despite the expected differences in the frequency of tumor types between the two sets of carriers, heterogeneity was observed in the distribution of rs299290 genotypes in BRCA1, but not BRCA2, mutation carriers	tumor	rs299290	
21	Importantly, both proteasome inhibition and BRCA1 depletion increased the abundance of RHAMM (Figure S7), which is also consistent with observed RHAMM over-expression in breast cancer cell lines derived from BRCA1 mutation carriers	breast cancer	S7	
22	This model is consistent with reduced expression of AURKA, TPX2, and HMMR, but to a lesser extent BRCA1, with polarization and growth arrest of nonmalignant mammary epithelial cells, as measured by gene expression profiling (Figure S11A)	growth arrest	S11A	
23	Accordingly, BRCA1 depletion increases the clonogenic potential of mammary epithelia, while a BRCA1 S308A mutant alters embryonic stem cell differentiation	epithelia	S308A
