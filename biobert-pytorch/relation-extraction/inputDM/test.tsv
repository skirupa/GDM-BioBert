4	The most common B-Raf mutation is a @Mutation$ transversion, resulting in a valine to glutamic acid substitution (V600E), present in approximately 90% of B-Raf mutant @Disease$ (Davies et al, 2002), which results in a 500-fold increase in in vitro kinase activity and the induction of cell proliferation and transformation (Wan et al, 2004)
5	The most common B-Raf mutation is a T to A transversion, resulting in a @Mutation$ substitution (V600E), present in approximately 90% of B-Raf mutant @Disease$ (Davies et al, 2002), which results in a 500-fold increase in in vitro kinase activity and the induction of cell proliferation and transformation (Wan et al, 2004)

7	Meanwhile, 1 mul chromosome 12p BAC RP11-707G18 (Red) (BlueGnome), 1 mul chromosome 12q BAC RP11-89H19 (Green) (BlueGnome) and 9 mul LSI-WCP hybridisation buffer (Vysis) was mixed together for each slide and pipetted onto a 22 x 22 mm coverslip which was placed onto a region of the slide containing @Disease$ tissue and placed onto a heat block at 75 @Mutation$ min to co-denature the probes and tumour tissue
