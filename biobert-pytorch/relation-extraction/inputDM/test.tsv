4	The most common B-Raf mutation is a @Mutation$ transversion, resulting in a valine to glutamic acid substitution (V600E), present in approximately 90% of B-Raf mutant @Disease$ (Davies et al, 2002), which results in a 500-fold increase in in vitro kinase activity and the induction of cell proliferation and transformation (Wan et al, 2004)

9	Mutations at codon 19 (@Mutation$, Leu19Phe) and in B-Raf (V600E) were found in single @Disease$ (Table 2).
10	Mutations at codon 19 (G57T, @Mutation$) and in B-Raf (V600E) were found in single @Disease$ (Table 2).
11	Mutations at codon 19 (G57T, Leu19Phe) and in B-Raf (@Mutation$) were found in single @Disease$ (Table 2).
12	Mutation analysis in @Disease$: functional and structural characterization of the HRAS @Mutation$ mutation
13	Following a pilot study in Italy and Spain, analysis of carriers (n = 11,609) collected through 24 study groups participating in the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA) detected significant modification of @Disease$ risk by HMMR @Mutation$ variant among BRCA1, but not BRCA2, mutation carriers: BRCA1 mutation carriers n = 7,584, Cox proportional-hazards regression model, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.08 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.13), ptrend = 0.004 (p 2df = 0.014), in the same direction as originally detected in Ashkenazi Jewish populations; BRCA2 mutation carriers n = 3,965, HR = 1.03 (95% CI 0.96-1.10), ptrend = 0.42 (p 2df = 0.67)
14	Effect of HMMR @Mutation$ variation on @Disease$ risk among BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.
15	However, while the @Mutation$ variant represents a missense change predicted to be benign (V368A; concordant predictions for PolyPhen-2 and @Disease$ were obtained), it is in linkage disequilibrium (according to HapMap Caucasians data: D' = 1 and r2 = 0.48) with rs299284 (R92C in Entrez accession number NP_036616), which is predicted to be damaging
16	However, while the rs299290 variant represents a missense change predicted to be benign (@Mutation$; concordant predictions for PolyPhen-2 and @Disease$ were obtained), it is in linkage disequilibrium (according to HapMap Caucasians data: D' = 1 and r2 = 0.48) with rs299284 (R92C in Entrez accession number NP_036616), which is predicted to be damaging
17	However, while the rs299290 variant represents a missense change predicted to be benign (V368A; concordant predictions for PolyPhen-2 and @Disease$ were obtained), it is in linkage disequilibrium (according to HapMap Caucasians data: D' = 1 and r2 = 0.48) with @Mutation$ (R92C in Entrez accession number NP_036616), which is predicted to be damaging

19	In data provided by several CIMBA groups (Text S1), no ER-positive @Disease$ were observed among rare @Mutation$ homozygotes in BRCA1 mutation carriers (p interaction = 0.006), whereas this bias was not observed in BRCA2 mutation carriers (p interaction = 0.95) (Table S4)
20	That is, despite the expected differences in the frequency of @Disease$ types between the two sets of carriers, heterogeneity was observed in the distribution of @Mutation$ genotypes in BRCA1, but not BRCA2, mutation carriers
21	Importantly, both proteasome inhibition and BRCA1 depletion increased the abundance of RHAMM (Figure @Mutation$), which is also consistent with observed RHAMM over-expression in @Disease$ cell lines derived from BRCA1 mutation carriers
22	This model is consistent with reduced expression of AURKA, TPX2, and HMMR, but to a lesser extent BRCA1, with polarization and @Disease$ of nonmalignant mammary epithelial cells, as measured by gene expression profiling (Figure @Mutation$)
23	Accordingly, BRCA1 depletion increases the clonogenic potential of mammary @Disease$, while a BRCA1 @Mutation$ mutant alters embryonic stem cell differentiation
