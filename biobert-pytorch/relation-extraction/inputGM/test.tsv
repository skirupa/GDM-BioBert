101	In contrast, the @Mutation$ mutation, like wt @Gene$, was not GTP-bound.
102	It is interesting to note that the codon 12 mutants were most similar to wt @Gene$, whereas the @Mutation$ and A146T mutants clustered with the activating codon 13 and codon 61 hotspot mutants

104	The presence of @Mutation$ in cluster 2, rather than in cluster 1 with wt @Gene$ was therefore initially surprising, but suggests that the R164Q mutation also has an 'activating' phenotype, albeit attenuated relative to the other mutations studied.

106	However, there were examples of genes that were induced by all of the mutants studied, including the protein tyrosine phosphatase @Gene$ and the Rho GTPase activating protein Arhgap6, and multiple examples of genes induced or repressed by all of the mutants with the exception of @Mutation$

109	The B-@Gene$ @Mutation$ mutation was detected using a novel RFLP assay, where the presence of the mutation destroyed a recognition site for the restriction enzyme TspRI
110	Samples without the @Gene$ @Mutation$ mutation were digested to produce bands of 124, 78 and 22 bp, whereas samples homozygous for the V599E mutation produced bands of 202 and 22 bp
