0	In @DISEASE$ patients, TLR-induced GM-CSF secretion was impaired by both @GENE$-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
1	The defect in GM-CSF secretion suggests a hitherto unknown role of NOD2 in the pathogenesis of @DISEASE$ and is consistent with the hypothesis that impaired @GENE$ secretion in part constitutes a NOD2-dependent disease risk factor.
2	Based on @GENE$ analyses, 41 @DISEASE$ patients and 12 healthy controls were studied.
3	Moreover, TNF-alpha production was induced by a @GENE$-2 ligand, but a down-regulatory function by the NOD2 ligand, muramyl dipeptide, was impaired significantly in @DISEASE$ patients.
4	@DISEASE$ patients have impaired @GENE$ secretion via NOD2-dependent and -independent pathways and display an impaired NOD2-dependent down-regulation of TNF-alpha secretion.
5	@DISEASE$ patients have impaired GM-CSF secretion via NOD2-dependent and -independent pathways and display an impaired NOD2-dependent down-regulation of @GENE$ secretion.
6	@DISEASE$ patients with NOD2 mutations were able to secrete TNF-alpha, but not @GENE$, upon stimulation with NOD2 and TLR-7 ligands.
7	In @DISEASE$ patients, TLR-induced @GENE$ secretion was impaired by both NOD2-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
8	Toll-like receptor-induced granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor secretion is impaired in @DISEASE$ by @GENE$-dependent and -independent pathways.
9	Elevation of @GENE$ expression in @DISEASE$ with Gsalpha protein mutation.
10	The expression of @GENE$ (GHRHR) is regulated by GHRH, both of which are known to be expressed in human @DISEASE$ cells.
11	These results suggest that gsp mutations up-regulate GHRHR mRNA expression in @DISEASE$ cells, and that gsp mutations desensitize the adenoma cells to GHRH in terms of their GHRHR mRNA expression probably because of their saturation of @GENE$ signaling.
12	The expression of GHRH receptor (GHRHR) is regulated by @GENE$, both of which are known to be expressed in human @DISEASE$ cells.
13	These results suggest that gsp mutations up-regulate GHRHR mRNA expression in @DISEASE$ cells, and that gsp mutations desensitize the adenoma cells to GHRH in terms of their @GENE$ expression probably because of their saturation of GHRH signaling.
14	@GENE$ play crucial roles in DNA replication and @DISEASE$.
15	Our data provide the first evidence that the @GENE$ polymorphism is associated with decreased risk of @DISEASE$.
16	To assess clinical significance, 93 @DISEASE$ lesions were evaluated for expression of @GENE$ and VEGFR-1 by immunohistochemistry.
17	To assess clinical significance, 93 @DISEASE$ lesions were evaluated for expression of VEGF and @GENE$ by immunohistochemistry.
18	Expression of VEGFR-1 (@GENE$) in @DISEASE$ is associated with VEGF expression and with node-negative tumour stage.
19	Expression of VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) in @DISEASE$ is associated with @GENE$ expression and with node-negative tumour stage.
20	@GENE$ was expressed in 60% and VEGFR-1 in 39% of @DISEASE$ specimens.
21	VEGF was expressed in 60% and @GENE$ in 39% of @DISEASE$ specimens.
22	Vascular endothelial growth factor (@GENE$) promotes @DISEASE$ progression by inducing angiogenesis via VEGF receptors on endothelial cells but also signals directly through receptors such as VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) expressed on tumour cells.
23	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes @DISEASE$ progression by inducing angiogenesis via VEGF receptors on endothelial cells but also signals directly through receptors such as VEGFR-1 (@GENE$) expressed on tumour cells.
24	Our objective was to determine whether variants in the @GENE$ gene are associated with @DISEASE$ in the Japanese population.
25	We genotyped the four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs706778, rs3118470, ss52580101, and rs11594656) of the @GENE$ in 885 patients with @DISEASE$ and 606 control subjects of Japanese origin.
26	The present data confirm the type 1 diabetes association with IL2RA and provide evidence that the different contributions of the @GENE$ in the susceptibility to acute-onset and other forms of @DISEASE$ in the Japanese population.
27	We found evidence of association with acute-onset, but not slow-onset and fulminant, @DISEASE$ for two of the four single-nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped (rs706778 and @GENE$).
28	We found evidence of association with acute-onset, but not slow-onset and fulminant, @DISEASE$ for two of the four single-nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped (@GENE$ and rs3118470).
29	@GENE$ protein is an extracellular matrix molecule initially cloned from human @DISEASE$ cells treated with TGF-beta.
30	Polymorphisms in the regulatory region of the @GENE$ gene influence the susceptibility for HIV-1 @DISEASE$.
31	Previous studies have demonstrated an association between polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of @GENE$ (CypA) and susceptibility to both HIV-1 @DISEASE$ and disease progression.
32	Previous studies have demonstrated an association between polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of Cyclophilin A (@GENE$) and susceptibility to both HIV-1 @DISEASE$ and disease progression.
33	No association of XRCC3 Thr241Met or @GENE$ and @DISEASE$ was found.
34	DNA repair gene polymorphisms, such as those of @GENE$ and xeroderma pigmentosum, complementation group D and G (XPD, XPG), contribute to @DISEASE$.
